    "text": "Descriptive statistics deals with methods to describe and summarize data.\nDescribing of data is effectively done through tables or graphs. Those often reveal important features such as the range, the degree of concentration, and the symmetry of the data.\nThe summary of data is expressed through numerical quantities (summary statistics) whose values are determined by the data.\n\n\n1.0.1 Describing Data sets\n\n\n1.0.2 Frequency Tables and Graphs\n\nA data set having a relatively small number of distinct values can be conveniently presented in a frequency table.\nData from a frequency table can be graphically represented by:\n\nLine Graph\nBar Graph\nFrequency Polygon\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\n# Sample data\ndata = np.array(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'A', 'B','B','B','B','B','B','C','C','C','C'])\n\n# Calculate frequencies\nvalues, frequencies = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)\n\n# Line Graph\nplt.plot(values, frequencies, marker='o')\nplt.title('Frequency Polygon')\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.show()\n\n\nplt.bar(values, frequencies, width=0.02)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.3 Relative Frequency Tables and Graphs\n\nConsider a data set consisting of n values. If f is the frequency of a particular value, then the ratio f /n is called its relative frequency.\nThat is, the relative frequency of a data value is the proportion of the data that have that value.\nThe relative frequencies can be represented graphically by:\n\nrelative frequency line\nrelative frequency bar graph\nrelative frequency polygon\npie chart: A pie chart is often used to indicate relative frequencies when the data are not numerical in nature. A circle is constructed and then sliced into different sectors with areas proportional to the respective relative frequencies.\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\n# Sample data\ndata = np.array(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'A', 'B','B','B','B','B','B','C','C','C','C'])\n\n# Calculate frequencies\nvalues, frequencies = np.unique(data, return_counts=True)\n\nrelative_frequencies = frequencies/len(data)\nprint(relative_frequencies)\n\n\nplt.pie(relative_frequencies, labels = values, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.show()\n\n[0.2        0.46666667 0.33333333]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.0.4 Grouped Data, Histograms, Ogives, and Stem and Leaf Plots\n\nFor some data sets the number of distinct values is too large to utilize frequency tables.\nInstead, in such cases, it is useful to divide the values into groupings, or class intervals, and then plot the number of data values falling in each class interval.\nThe number of class intervals chosen should be a trade-off between:\n\nchoosing too few classes at a cost of losing too much information about the actual data values in a class.\nchoosing too many classes, which will result in the frequencies of each class being too small.\n\nIt is common, although not essential, to choose class intervals of equal length.\nThe endpoints of a class interval are called the class boundaries.\nWe will adopt the left-end inclusion convention, which stipulates that a class interval contains its left-end but not its right-end boundary point.\nThus, for instance, the class interval 20-30 contains all values that are both greater than or equal to 20 and less than 30.\nA bar graph plot of class data, with the bars placed adjacent to each other, is called a histogram.\nThe vertical axis of a histogram can represent either the class frequency or the relative class frequency.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(50)\n\n# Generate 300 random integers between 100 and 1500\nrandom_integers = np.random.randint(100, 1501, size=300)\n\n# Create bins for the class intervals\nbins = np.arange(100, 1600, 100)\nprint(bins)\n\n# Plot histogram\nplt.hist(random_integers, bins=bins, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Histogram of Random Integers')\nplt.xlabel('Class Interval')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n\n[ 100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400\n 1500]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are sometimes interested in plotting a cumulative frequency (or cumulative relative frequency) graph.\nA point on the horizontal axis of such a graph represents a possible data value; its corresponding vertical plot gives the number (or proportion) of the data whose values are less than or equal to it.\nA cumulative frequency plot is called an ogive.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(50)\n\n# Generate 300 random integers between 100 and 1500\nrandom_integers = np.random.randint(100, 1501, size=300)\n\n# Create bins for the class intervals\nbins = np.arange(100, 1600, 100)\nprint(bins)\n\nhistograms = np.histogram(random_integers, bins=bins)[0]\nprint(histograms)\ncumulativeSum = np.cumsum(histograms) \nprint(cumulativeSum)\n\n\nplt.plot(bins[:-1], cumulativeSum, marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.title('Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Graph)')\nplt.xlabel('Class Interval')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Frequency')\n#plt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n[ 100  200  300  400  500  600  700  800  900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400\n 1500]\n[22 25 15 24 14 21 20 24 19 21 23 21 28 23]\n[ 22  47  62  86 100 121 141 165 184 205 228 249 277 300]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn efficient way of organizing a small-to moderate-sized data set is to utilize a stem and leaf plot.\nSuch a plot is obtained by first dividing each data value into two parts - its stem and its leaf.\nFor instance, if the data are all two-digit numbers, then we could let the stem part of a data value be its tens digit and let the leaf be its ones digit.\nThus, for instance, the value 62 is expressed as\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\ndata = np.array([62, 67, 63, 68, 69, 61, 64, 65, 66, 60, 75, 74, 76, 78, 90, 92, 34, 36, 56, 57, 45, 53, 52, 59, 73, 74, 79, 80, 81,20, 34, 36, 85])\n\n# Create stem and leaf plot\nstem_leaf = {}\n\nfor number in data:\n    stem = number // 10\n    leaf = number % 10\n    if stem in stem_leaf:\n        stem_leaf[stem].append(leaf)\n    else:\n        stem_leaf[stem] = [leaf]\n\n# Print stem and leaf plot\nfor stem, leaves in sorted(stem_leaf.items()):\n    print(f\"{stem} | {' '.join(map(str, sorted(leaves)))}\")\n\n2 | 0\n3 | 4 4 6 6\n4 | 5\n5 | 2 3 6 7 9\n6 | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n7 | 3 4 4 5 6 8 9\n8 | 0 1 5\n9 | 0 2",

    "text": "2.2 Interval Estimates\n\nConsider a sample \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) drawn from a known distribution with an unknown mean \\(\\mu\\).\nIt is established that the sample mean \\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\) serves as the maximum likelihood estimator for \\(\\mu\\).\nHowever, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) is not expected to be exactly equal to \\(\\mu\\), but rather close to it.\nTherefore, instead of providing a single point estimate, it is often more useful to specify an interval within which we are confident that \\(\\mu\\) lies.\nTo determine such an interval estimator, we utilize the probability distribution of the point estimator.\n\n\n2.2.1 Confidence Intervals for the Mean of a normal population with known Variance\n\nConsider a sample \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) drawn from a normal distribution with an unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and a known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThe point estimator \\(\\bar{X}\\) is normal with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\)/n.\nTherefore, \\(\\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\) follows a standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\nConsider that I want to find an interval around \\(\\bar{X}\\) such that the actual population mean \\(\\mu\\) falls within the interval, say 95 % of the times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nFor finding such an interval, I can use the Z-table. From the Z-table I can find:\n\n\\[\nP\\left( -1.96 &lt; \\frac{\\bar{X} -\\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} &lt; 1.96 \\right) = 0.9750 - 0.0250 = 0.95\n\\]\n\nRewriting the above equation:\n\n\\[\nP\\left( -1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\bar{X} -\\mu &lt; 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 0.95\n\\]\n\\[\nP\\left( 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &gt; \\mu - \\bar{X} &gt; -1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 0.95\n\\]\n\\[\nP\\left( -1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\mu - \\bar{X} &lt; 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 0.95\n\\]\n\\[\nP\\left( \\bar{X} - 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar{X} + 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 0.95\n\\]\n\nWe have P(Z &lt; -1.96) = 0.025, similarly P(Z &gt; 1.96) = 0.025.

    "text": "4.1 With known Variance (Z-test)\n\nLet \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a sample of size \\(n\\) from a normal distribution with an unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and a known variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nWe are interested in testing the null hypothesis:\n\n\\[\nH_0 : \\mu = \\mu_0\n\\]\n\nAgainst the alternative hypothesis:\n\n\\[\nH_1 : \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\mu_0\\) is a specified constant.\nSince \\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\) is a natural point estimator of \\(\\mu\\), it is reasonable to accept \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\bar{X}\\) is not too far from \\(\\mu_0\\).\nThus, the critical region of the test would be of the form:\n\n\\[\nC = \\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n : |\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| &gt; c\\}\n\\]\nfor some suitably chosen value \\(c\\).\n\nTo ensure that the test has a significance level \\(\\alpha\\), we must determine the critical value \\(c\\) in the above equation such that the type I error is equal to \\(\\alpha\\). This means \\(c\\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\mu_0} \\{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| &gt; c\\} = \\alpha\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_{\\mu_0}\\) denotes that the probability is computed under the assumption that population mean, \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\).\n\nWhen \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\), \\(\\bar{X}\\) follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_0\\) and variance \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\). Therefore, the standardized variable \\(Z\\) defined by:\n\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nwill have a standard normal distribution.\n\nThe probability of a type I error is given by:\n\n\\[\nP \\left( |\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| &gt; c \\right) = \\alpha\n\\]\n\nEquivalently, this can be written as:\n\n\\[\n2P \\left( Z &gt; \\frac{c \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma} \\right) = \\alpha\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(Z\\) is a standard normal random variable. We know that:\n\n\\[\nP \\left( Z &gt; z_{\\alpha/2} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma} = z_{\\alpha/2}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(c\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the test at significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is to reject \\(H_0\\) if:\n\n\\[\n|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0| &gt; \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\n\nAnd accept \\(H_0\\) otherwise. Equivalently, we can reject \\(H_0\\) if:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} \\frac{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0|}{\\sigma} &gt; z_{\\alpha/2}\n\\]\n\nAnd accept \\(H_0\\) if:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{n} \\frac{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0|}{\\sigma} \\leq z_{\\alpha/2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nIf a signal of value \\(\\mu\\) is sent from location A, then the value received at location B is normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation 2. That is, the random noise added to the signal is an N(0, 4) random variable. There is reason for the people at location B to suspect that the signal value \\(\\mu\\) = 8 will be sent today. Test this hypothesis if the same signal value is independently sent five times and the average value received at location B is X = 9. 5.\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Choosing the Significance Level\n\nThe appropriate significance level \\(\\alpha\\) depends on the specific context and consequences of the hypothesis test.\nIf rejecting the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) would lead to significant costs or consequences, a more conservative significance level (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) should be chosen.\nIf there is a strong initial belief that \\(H_0\\) is true, strict evidence is required to reject \\(H_0\\), implying a lower significance level.\nThe test can be described as follows: For an observed value of the test statistic \\(\\sqrt{n} \\frac{|\\bar{X} - \\mu_0|}{\\sigma}\\), denoted as \\(v\\), reject \\(H_0\\) if the probability of the test statistic being as large as \\(v\\) under \\(H_0\\) is less than or equal to \\(\\alpha\\).\nThis probability is known as the p-value of the test. \\(H_0\\) is accepted if \\(\\alpha\\) is less than the p-value and rejected if \\(\\alpha\\) is greater than or equal to the p-value.\nIn practice, the significance level is sometimes not set in advance. Instead, the p-value is calculated from the data, and decisions are made based on the p-value.\nIf the p-value is much larger than any reasonable significance level, \\(H_0\\) is accepted. Conversely, if the p-value is very small, \\(H_0\\) is rejected.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Hypothesis Testing Summary: Z- Test\n\nCaption: Summary of hypothesis testing for a sample from a \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) population with known \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample and Population\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\\(\\{X_1, X_2, . . . , X_n\\}\\)\n\n\nPopulation\n\\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\)\n\n\nKnown Parameter\n\\(\\sigma^2\\)\n\n\nSample Mean\n\\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\)\n\n\nSignificance Level\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\nTest Statistic (TS)\nReject if\np-Value if TS = t\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0\\) vs \\(H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)/\\sigma\\)\n\\(|TS| &gt; z_{\\alpha/2}\\)\n\\(2P\\{Z \\geq |t|\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu \\leq \\mu_0\\) vs \\(H_1: \\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)/\\sigma\\)\n\\(TS &gt; z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(P\\{Z \\geq t\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu \\geq \\mu_0\\) vs \\(H_1: \\mu &lt; \\mu_0\\)\n\\(\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X} - \\mu_0)/\\sigma\\)\n\\(TS &lt; -z_{\\alpha}\\)\n\\(P\\{Z \\leq t\\}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nImagine you’re the quality control manager at a company that prides itself on the precision of its product weights.

The statistic SSW is called the Sum of Squares Within Samples aka ( within samples sum of squares or sum of squares within groups).\nAlso, note that this estimator was obtained without assuming anything about the truth or falsity of the null hypothesis.\nOur second estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is valid only when the null hypothesis is true.\n\nAssume \\(H_0\\) is true, meaning all population means \\(\\mu_i\\) are equal, i.e., \\(\\mu_i = \\mu\\) for all \\(i\\).\nUnder this assumption:\n\nThe sample means \\(\\bar{X}_1, \\bar{X}_2, \\dots, \\bar{X}_m\\) are normally distributed with:\n\nMean: \\(\\mu\\).\nVariance: \\(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\).\n\n\n\nWe have; \\[\n\\frac{\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\n\\] follows a standard normal distribution; hence, \\[\n  n \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2} \\sim \\chi^2_m\n   \\tag{4.3}\\] follows a chi-square distribution with m degrees of freedom when \\(H_0\\) is true.\nWhen all population means are equal to \\(\\mu\\), the estimator of \\(\\mu\\) is the average of all nm data values, denoted as \\(\\bar{X}_{..}\\): \\[\n\\bar{X}_{..} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}}{nm} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\bar{X}_{i.}}{m}\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(\\bar{X}_{..}\\) for the unknown parameter \\(\\mu\\) in Equation 4.3:\n\nWhen \\(H_0\\) is true, the resulting quantity: \\[\nn \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\bar{X}_{..})^2}{\\sigma^2}\n\\]\n\nThe resulting quantity: \\[\nn \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\bar{X}_{..})^2}{\\sigma^2}\n\\] will be a chi-square random variable with m - 1 degrees of freedom.\nDefine SSb as: \\[\nSSb = n \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\bar{X}_{..})^2\n\\tag{4.4}\\]\n\nIt follows that, when \\(H_0\\) is true: \\[\nSSb / \\sigma^2 \\sim \\chi^2_{m-1}\n\\]\n\nFrom the above, we derive that when \\(H_0\\) is true: \\[\nE[SSb] / \\sigma^2 = m - 1\n\\]\n\nEquivalently: \\[\nE[SSb / (m - 1)] = \\sigma^2\n\\tag{4.5}\\]\n\nTherefore, when \\(H_0\\) is true, \\(SSb / (m - 1)\\) is also an estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThe quantity SSb Equation 4.4 is called the sum of squares between samples or between samples sum of squares or sum of squares between groups.\nNote that \\(E[SSb / (m - 1)]\\) is an estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) only if the hypothesis is true.\nThus we have shown that;\n\n\\(\\frac{SSW}{nm-m}\\) always estimates \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\\(\\frac{SSb}{m-1}\\) estimates \\(\\sigma^2\\) when \\(H_0\\) is true.\n\nBecause it can be shown that \\(\\frac{SSb}{m-1}\\) will tend to exceed \\(\\sigma^2\\) when \\(H_0\\) is not true, now it is reasonable to let the test statistic be given by\n\n\\[\nTS= \\frac{\\frac{SSb}{m-1} } {\\frac{SSW}{nm-m}}\n\\]\nand to reject \\(H_0\\) when \\(TS\\) is sufficiently large.\n\nHow to do the hypothesis testing\n\nTo determine how large \\(TS\\) needs to be to justify rejecting \\(H_0\\), we use the fact that:\n\nIf \\(H_0\\) is true, then \\(SSb\\) and \\(SSW\\) are independent.\nIt follows that, when \\(H_0\\) is true, \\(TS\\) has an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(m-1\\) numerator and \\(nm-m\\) denominator degrees of freedom.\nLet \\(F_{m-1,nm-m,\\alpha}\\) denote the \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\) percentile of this distribution — that is, \\(P\\{F_{m-1,nm-m} &gt; F_{m-1,nm-m,\\alpha}\\} = \\alpha\\).\nWe use the notation \\(F_{r,s}\\) to represent an \\(F\\)-random variable with \\(r\\) numerator and \\(s\\) denominator degrees of freedom.\n\nThe significance level \\(\\alpha\\) test of \\(H_0\\) is as follows:\n\nReject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\frac{\\frac{SSb}{m-1} }{ \\frac{SSW}{nm-m}} &gt; F_{m-1,nm-m,\\alpha}\\).\nDo not reject \\(H_0\\), otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe following algebraic identity, known as the sum of squares identity, is useful for simplifying computations, especially when done by hand:\nThe Sum of Squares Identity: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}^2 = nm \\bar{X}_{..}^2 + SSb + SSW\n\\]\n\nHere:\n\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}^2\\) represents the total sum of squares of all observations.\n\\(nm \\bar{X}_{..}^2\\) is the contribution from the grand mean (\\(\\bar{X}_{..}\\)).\n\\(SSb\\) (Sum of Squares Between) measures the variation between sample means.\n\\(SSW\\) (Sum of Squares Within) measures the variation within each sample.\n\n\nThis identity helps decompose the total variability in the data into components that can be analyzed separately.\nWhen performing calculations by hand, the quantity SSb (Sum of Squares Between) should be computed first. It is defined as: \\[\nSSb = n \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\bar{X}_{..})^2\n\\]\nOnce SSb has been calculated, SSW (Sum of Squares Within) can be determined using the sum of squares identity. To do this:\n\nCompute the total sum of squares: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}^2\n\\]\nCompute the term involving the grand mean: \\[\nnm \\bar{X}_{..}^2\n\\]\nUse the sum of squares identity to find SSW: \\[\nSSW = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} X_{ij}^2 - nm \\bar{X}_{..}^2 - SSb\n\\]\n\nThis approach simplifies the computation process by breaking it into manageable steps and leveraging the sum of squares identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Method\n\n\n\nAnother useful identity involving the sum of squares is:\nError Sum of Squares (\\(SS_{total}\\)): \\(SS_{total}=SSb + SSW\\)\nwhere Total Sum of Squares (\\(SS_{total}\\)): \\(SS_{total}=\\sum_{i=1}^m\\sum_{j=1}^n(X_{ij}-\\bar{X}_{..})^2\\)\n\nThis identity can also be used for the anova analysis while performing the computations by hand.\nThis approach too simplifies the computation process by breaking it into manageable steps and leveraging the sum of squares identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of one-way analysis of variance\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Source of Variation} & \\textbf{Sum of Squares} & \\textbf{Degrees of Freedom} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Between samples} & SS_b = n \\sum_{i=1}^m (\\bar{X}_{i.} - \\bar{X}_{..})^2 & m - 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Within samples} & SS_W = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^n (X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_{i.})^2 & nm - m \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nValue of Test Statistic, \\(TS = \\frac{SS_b/(m-1)}{SS_W/(nm-m)}\\)\nSignificance level \\(\\alpha\\) test:\nreject \\(H_0\\) if \\(TS \\geq F_{m-1,nm-m,\\alpha}\\)\ndo not reject otherwise\nIf \\(TS = v\\), then \\(p\\)-value = \\(P\\{F_{m-1,nm-m} \\geq v\\}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nAn auto rental firm is using 15 identical motors that are adjusted to run at a fixed speed to test 3 different brands of gasoline. Each brand of gasoline is assigned to exactly 5 of the motors. Each motor runs on 10 gallons of gasoline until it is out of fuel. The following data represents the total mileages achieved by different motors using three types of gas:\n\nGas 1: \\(220, 251, 226, 246, 260\\)\nGas 2: \\(244, 235, 232, 242, 225\\)\nGas 3: \\(252, 272, 250, 238, 256\\)\n\nTest the hypothesis that the average mileage is not affected by the type of gas used.

Here’s a detailed explanation:\n\n\nWhat Are Degrees of Freedom?\n\nDegrees of freedom (df) represent the number of independent pieces of information available to estimate a parameter or test a hypothesis.\nIn simpler terms, it’s the number of values in a calculation that are free to vary after certain constraints (like estimating parameters) are applied.\n\n\n\nWhy Are Degrees of Freedom Lost?\n\nWhen you estimate parameters (e.g., population means, variances) from sample data, you use the data itself to calculate these estimates.\nEach time you estimate a parameter, you impose a constraint on the data, reducing the number of independent pieces of information available.\nExample: If you estimate the sample mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)) from a dataset, you use the data to calculate \\(\\bar{X}\\). This means one piece of information (one degree of freedom) is “used up” in estimating \\(\\bar{X}\\), and the remaining data points are no longer fully independent.\n\n\n\nApplication in the Context of the Problem\n\nIn the given problem:\n\nYou have m samples, each of size n, and you estimate the mean of each sample (\\(\\mu_i\\)) using the sample mean (\\(\\bar{X}_{i.}\\)).\nEach time you estimate a mean (\\(\\mu_i\\)), you lose one degree of freedom because the data is used to calculate that estimate.\nSince you estimate m means (\\(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\dots, \\mu_m\\)), you lose m degrees of freedom in total.\n\n\n\n\nMathematical Explanation\n\nInitially, the sum of squares: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_{ij} - \\mu_i)^2}{\\sigma^2}\n\\] follows a chi-square distribution with nm degrees of freedom (since there are nm independent observations).\nHowever, when you replace the true means (\\(\\mu_i\\)) with their estimates (\\(\\bar{X}_{i.}\\)), you lose m degrees of freedom (one for each estimated mean). This is because the estimates are derived from the data, reducing the independence of the observations.\nAs a result, the modified sum of squares: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_{i.})^2}{\\sigma^2}\n\\] follows a chi-square distribution with nm - m degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nDegrees of freedom affect the shape and critical values of the chi-square distribution, which is used for hypothesis testing.\nLosing degrees of freedom accounts for the fact that estimating parameters introduces uncertainty into the analysis.\nThis adjustment ensures that statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) are accurate and reliable.\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nDegrees of freedom represent independent information in the data.\nEach estimated parameter (e.g., a mean) reduces the degrees of freedom by 1 because the data is used to calculate the estimate.\nIn the problem, estimating m means reduces the degrees of freedom from nm to nm - m, ensuring the chi-square distribution is correctly applied.",

    "text": "5.0.1 Linear Regression\n\nMany engineering and scientific problems aim to determine relationships between variables.\n\nExample: In a chemical process, the relationship between output, temperature, and catalyst amount is of interest.\nKnowing this relationship allows predicting outputs for different temperature and catalyst values.\n\nTypically, there is a single response variable \\(Y\\) (dependent variable) that depends on a set of input variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_r\\) (independent variables).\nThe simplest relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_r\\) is a linear relationship: \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_r x_r\n\\tag{5.1}\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_r\\) are constants.\n\nIn practice, exact predictions are rarely possible due to random errors.\n\nThe relationship is better expressed as: \\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_r x_r + e\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\n\\(e\\) represents the random error, assumed to have a mean of \\(0\\).\n\n\nAlternatively, the relationship can be expressed in terms of the expected value: \\[\nE[Y \\mid \\mathbf{x}] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_r x_r\n\\]\n\n\\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_r)\\) is the set of independent variables.\n\\(E[Y \\mid \\mathbf{x}]\\) is the expected response given the inputs \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\n\nThe Equation 5.2 is called a linear regression equation.\n\nIt describes the regression of \\(Y\\) on the independent variables \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_r\\).\nThe quantities \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_r\\) are called regression coefficients, and must usually be estimated from a set of data.\n\nA regression equation can be classified based on the number of independent variables:\n\nSimple regression equation: Contains a single independent variable (\\(r = 1\\)).\nMultiple regression equation: Contains many independent variables.\n\nA simple linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the mean response and a single independent variable.\n\nIt is expressed as: \\[\nY = \\alpha + \\beta x + e\n\\]\n\n\\(x\\) is the value of the independent variable (also called the input level).\n\\(Y\\) is the response.\n\\(e\\) represents the random error, assumed to be a random variable with mean \\(0\\).\nRegression analysis is used to find the mean value of the dependent variable \\(Y\\) given the independent variables \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\n\nThe mean value of \\(Y\\) given \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is denoted as \\(E[Y \\mid \\mathbf{x}]\\).\nBy estimating the regression coefficients \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_r\\), we can predict the mean response for any given set of input variables.\nThis is particularly useful in understanding the central tendency of the response variable and making informed decisions based on the predicted mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set random seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Parameters for the linear regression model\nalpha = 2.0  # Intercept\nbeta = 1.5   # Slope\nnum_samples = 100  # Number of data points\n\n# Generate synthetic data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, num_samples)  # Independent variable (input)\ne = np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)  # Random error with mean 0\nY = alpha + beta * x + e  # Dependent variable (response)\n\n# Plot the data points\nplt.scatter(x, Y, color='blue', label='Data Points')\n\n# Plot the true regression line (without error)\nplt.plot(x, alpha + beta * x, color='red', label='True Regression Line')\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Independent Variable (x)')\nplt.ylabel('Dependent/ Response Variable (Y)')\nplt.title('Simple Linear Regression Demonstration')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Least Squares Estimators Of The Regression Parameters\n\nAs mentioned previouslly, a simple linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between the mean response and a single independent variable.\n\nIt is expressed as: \\[\nY = \\alpha + \\beta x + e\n\\]\n\n\\(x\\) is the value of the independent variable (also called the input level).\n\\(Y\\) is the response.\n\\(e\\) represents the random error, assumed to be a random variable with mean \\(0\\).\n\n\nSuppose the responses \\(Y_i\\) corresponding to the input values \\(x_i\\) for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\) are observed and used to estimate \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) in a simple linear regression model.\n\nLet \\(A\\) be the estimator of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(B\\) be the estimator of \\(\\beta\\).\nThe estimated response for the input \\(x_i\\) is \\(A + Bx_i\\).\nThe squared difference between the actual response \\(Y_i\\) and the estimated response is \\((Y_i - A - Bx_i)^2\\).\n\nThe sum of squared differences (SS) is given by: \\[\nSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - A - Bx_i)^2\n\\]\nThe method of least squares chooses \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to minimize \\(SS\\).\n\nTo find the minimizing values, differentiate \\(SS\\) with respect to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\partial SS}{\\partial A} = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - A - Bx_i)\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{\\partial SS}{\\partial B} = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (Y_i - A - Bx_i)\n\\]\nSetting the partial derivatives to zero yields the normal equations: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = nA + B \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n\\] \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Y_i = A \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + B \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\n\\]\n\nLet \\(\\overline{Y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i}{n}\\) and \\(\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\\).\n\nThe first normal equation can be rewritten as: \\[\nA = \\overline{Y} - B \\overline{x}\n\\tag{5.3}\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(A = \\overline{Y} - B \\overline{x}\\) into the second normal equation: \\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Y_i = (\\overline{Y} - B \\overline{x}) n \\overline{x} + B \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\n\\]\nSimplifying: \\[\nB \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \\overline{x}^2 \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Y_i - n \\overline{x} \\overline{Y}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(B\\):\n\\[\nB = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Y_i - n \\overline{x} \\overline{Y}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \\overline{x}^2}\n\\]\nUsing Equation 5.3 and the fact that \\(n \\overline{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\), we obtain the estimators for \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeast Squares Estimators\n\n\n\n\nThe least squares estimators of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) for the data set \\((x_i, Y_i)\\), where \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), are given by:\n\nThe estimator for \\(\\beta\\) (\\(B\\)): \\[\nB = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i Y_i - \\overline{x} \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \\overline{x}^2}\n\\]\nThe estimator for \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(A\\)): \\[\nA = \\overline{Y} - B \\overline{x}\n\\]\nHere:\n\n\\(\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}\\) is the mean of the independent variable \\(x\\).\n\\(\\overline{Y} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i}{n}\\) is the mean of the dependent variable \\(Y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem\n\n\n\nThe raw material used in the production of a certain synthetic fiber is stored in a location without humidity control. Measurements of the relative humidity in the storage location and the moisture content of a sample of the raw material were taken over 15 days, resulting in the following data (in percentages):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative Humidity (%)\n46\n53\n29\n61\n36\n39\n47\n49\n52\n38\n55\n32\n57\n54\n44\n\n\n\n\nMoisture Content (%)\n12\n15\n7\n17\n10\n11\n11\n12\n14\n9\n16\n8\n18\n14\n12\n\n\n\nUse linear regression to express moisture content as a function of the relative humidity.",
